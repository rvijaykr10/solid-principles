Summary of SOLID Principles with FastAPI Examples
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each module/class should have only one responsibility.
FastAPI Example:
Separate user registration logic (UserRegistrationService) from database operations (UserDatabaseService) to keep each class focused on a single task.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
FastAPI Example:
Add a new type of logger (e.g., FileLogger) without modifying the existing logging mechanism (log_event function).
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subclasses should be substitutable for their parent classes.
FastAPI Example:
Use a common interface (DatabaseService) to interchangeably use PostgresService or MongoDBService for saving data.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

A class should not implement methods it doesn't use.
FastAPI Example:
Split user actions into separate interfaces (CanLogin, CanRegister), ensuring no unnecessary methods are implemented in unrelated services.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than low-level modules.
FastAPI Example:
Use dependency injection in FastAPI to abstract user repository operations (UserRepository) and inject them into the service layer (UserService).
Benefits of Applying SOLID Principles in FastAPI:

Maintainability: Modular code makes it easier to update or debug specific parts.
Scalability: Clear separation of concerns allows easy addition of new features.
Testability: Smaller, focused components are easier to test.
Flexibility: Abstractions and dependency injection enable changes without breaking existing functionality.
By following SOLID principles, you can create a robust and scalable FastAPI project while adhering to clean architecture principles. ðŸš€
